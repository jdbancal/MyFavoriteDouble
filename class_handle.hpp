  This file provides three functions :
    - createMatlabIdFromObj
    - recoverObjFromMatlabId
    - destroyObject
  which allow one to easily keep track of c++ class objects allocated
  dynamically between two calls from matlab.

  A typical usage starts by calling the function "createMatlabIdFromObj<T>" with some
  dynamically allocated object of type T (i.e. created with the 'new' function).
  This function creates a class_handle instance to keep track of the object of
  type T and returns a pointer to an integer (meant to be used by matlab). This
  integer is a recasted pointer to the class_handle instance that manages the
  object of type T. It can thus be used as an identifier for this object (no two
  objects can have the same identifier).

  Recovering the object of type T corresponding to a given identifier at a later
  time is easily accomplished by calling the function recoverObjFromMatlabId with a
  pointer to the object's identifier. After checking the validity of the
  identifier, this function returns a reference to the corresponding object of
  type T. This object can then be easily manipulated.

  Finally, calling the function destroyObject, again with a pointer to the
  corresponding identifier, allows one to safely delete the object, together
  with its corresponding class_handle instance. Note that once an object has
  been assigned an identifier, it should only be deleted with this function.

  Example :
  ---------
    // We create a new object dynamically
    int& object = *(new int);
    object = 2;

    // Now we return the
    plhs[0] = createMatlabIdFromObj<T>(object);

    // Here we can exit the library and go back to matlab: our object remains in
    // memory and matlab has its identifier.

    ...

    // Now, matlab asks us to do something with our object. It sends us a
    // pointer to the object's identifier in prhs[1]. We start by reactivating
    // the object :
    int& object2 = recoverObjFromMatlabId<T>(prhs[1]);

    // Now we can apply operations on this object:
    object2 += 1;

    // Matlab still has a copy of the identifier, so we don't need to call
    // convertObjb2Mat anymore before handing back the hand to matlab. In fact,
    // we should not call converObj2Mat two times with the same object: this
    // would create several instances of the class_handle for the same object,
    // but only one can later clear the memory.

    ...

    // Now, matlab asks us to delete the our object. It sends us a pointer to
    // the object's identifier in prhs[1]. We call the dedicated delete
    // procedure to do the job. This deletes both our object, and the
    // class_handle instance which kept track of it.
    deleteObject(prhs[1]);


  More details on this file :
  ---------------------------
  The class used here to keep track of c++ object contains three fields:
    - a pointer
    - a signature
    - a name

  When constructed from an object of some type, a pointer to this object is
  copied internally and the two other variables are set as follows :
    - the signature is assigned a value proper to the current implementation
    - the type of the object the pointer points to is remembered in 'name_m'

  These informations allow one to safely reactivate a zone of memory containing
  such an object by just using a pointer to a class instance defined here.
  Indeed, if this pointer points to a zone of memory with a valid signature, and
  a name describing the expected variable type, then one can safely assume that
  the pointer within this class is also a valid one. This last point, however
  cannot be truly checked: for instance, it could be that the memory has been
  freed in the mean time. To avoid this problem, one should only pass here
  objects allocated dynamically, and on should use the dedicated function
  deleteObject to delete the object.
